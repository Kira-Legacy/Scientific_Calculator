# Scientific_Calculator
## A Scientific Calculator built with C++

- A scientific calculator is a calculator designed to help calculate science, engineering, and 
mathematics problems. It contains Operation, Trigonometric function, Logarithmic function,
Factorial and etc.

- This project is to create a scientific calculator using c++. On this project fundamental concepts of C++ were used including
functions, loops, libraries and switch statements.

- The built scientific calculator can perform 15 distnict operations which are: - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Exponent, Square root, Sine, Cosine, Tangent, Inverse of sine, Inverse of Cosine, Inverse of Tangent, Lograrithm, Logarithm with base 10 and Factorial.

- Header files io stream and cmath were used through out the project. cmath allows to use pre-defined c++ mathematical 
functions. Switch is a type of selective statement which allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each 
value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each case.

- The total cases of the code are 15. When the input value(c) lies between 1 and 15 the program
takes the value as case number and performs specific operations based on the following format:

      1 = Addition
      2 = Subtraction
      3 = Multiplication
      4 = Division    
      5 = Exponent
      6 = Square root
      7 = Sine
      8 = Cosine
      9 = Tangent
      10 = Inverse of Sine
      11 = Inverse of Cosine
      12 = Inverse of Tangent
      13 = Logarithm
      14 = Logarithm with base 10
      15 = Factorial

- When 0 is recieved as input, the calculator terminates.
