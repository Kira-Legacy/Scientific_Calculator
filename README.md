# Scientific_Calculator
# A Scientific Calculator built with C++
-> A scientific calculator is a calculator designed to help calculate science, engineering, and 
mathematics problems. It contains Operation, Trigonometric function, Logarithmic function,
Factorial and etc.

-> This project is to create a scientific calculator using c++. On this project fundamental concepts of C++ were used including
functions, loops, libraries and switch statements.

-> The built scientific calculator can perform 15 distnict operations which are: - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Exponent, Square root, Sine, Cosine, Tangent, Inverse of sine, Inverse of Cosine, Inverse of Tangent, Lograrithm, Logarithm with base 10 and Factorial.

-> Header files io stream and cmath were used through out the project. cmath allows to use pre-defined c++ mathematical 
functions. Switch is a type of selective statement which allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each 
value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each case.

-> The total cases of the code are 15. When the input value(c) lies between 1 and 15 the program
takes the value as case number and performs specific operations based on the following format:

- For value 1 – Addition
- For value 2 – Subtraction
- For value 3 – Multiplication
- For value 4 – Division
- For value 5 – Exponent
- For value 6 – Square root
- For value 7 – Sine
- For value 8 – Cosine
- For value 9 – Tangent
- For vale 10 – Inverse of Sine
- For value 11 – Inverse of Cosine
- For value – Inverse of Tangent
- For value 13 – Logarithm
- For value 14 – Logarithm with base 10
- For value 15 – Factorial

-> When 0 is recieved as input, the calculator terminates.
